## Introduction

Image watermarking is a technique to embed a visible or invisible mark into an image for copyright protection or to show ownership. This project provides various watermarking techniques, including insertion in spatial domain, transformation domain, and pixel modification.

Additionally, the application allows for generating image attacks, such as removing regions, compression, and filtering, to evaluate the robustness of watermarking techniques.

## Features

- Apply watermarks to images using different techniques
- Generate attacks on images, such as removing regions, compression, and filtering
- Graphical User Interface (GUI) for easy interaction
- Measure execution time, CPU usage, memory usage, and Mean Squared Error (MSE) for evaluation
- Save watermarked images and attacked images

## Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- tkinter (for GUI)
- numpy
- opencv-python
- pillow
- scikit-image

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your_username/image-watermark-attacks.git
```

2. Change the directory to the project folder:

```bash
cd image-watermark-attacks
```

3. Install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To run the application, execute the following command:

```bash
python main.py
```

The GUI will open, allowing you to select and apply different watermarking techniques to the loaded image. You can also generate attacks on the image and save the watermarked or attacked images.
